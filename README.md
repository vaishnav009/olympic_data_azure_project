# Olympic Data Analysis Using Microsoft Azure Cloud Services

## Introduction 
In this project, I have executed an End-To-End Data pipeline which reads data from a remote source using Azure DataFactory and stores it in Azure Data Lake Storage. Next step reads data from Azure Data Lake Storage, performs some transformations on it using Azure Databricks and stores data back to Azure Data Lake Storage.
We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Azure DataFactory, Azure Databricks.
